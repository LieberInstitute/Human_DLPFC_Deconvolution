Raw Data
========

## bulkRNA
**Round 1** Oct-2021  
`bulkRNA/2107UNHS-0291/`  
`bulkRNA/2107UNHS-0293/`

**Round 2** Feb-2022  
Transfered from `/dcs04/lieber/data/transfers/psomagen/` with `_jhpce_org/move_bulk_round2.sh`  
`AN00000906`

**Other**: `bulkRNA/flat_dir`: this is a non-version-controlled directory of soft links to rounds 1 and 2 of FASTQs, with all FASTQs stored at the same level (i.e. no complex subdirectory structure). This is necessary for upload to SRA.

## RNAscope_images

* This directory is accessible through the Globus endpoint <https://research.libd.org/globus/jhpce_humanDeconvolutionRNAScope/>.
* `raw_images_to_share`: this directory contains the 24 TIF raw images that are ready to be analyzed by HALO. As noted on `Deconvolution_HALO_Analysis.xlsx`:
  - Allsection images contain 4 sections (listed in __columns P__ and __Q__). The order of the sections is denoted by letters A-D, read in a top to bottom fashion. Where the top section is ""A"", the section below is ""B"", below that section is ""C"", and the final/bottom section is ""D."". These letters can be found in __column B__. The slide number in this case does not matter.
  - These 24 raw images are also available through DOI [10.5281/zenodo.14969130](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14969130).
