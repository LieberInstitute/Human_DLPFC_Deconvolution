Recently, long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) were reported to play important roles in mental diseases. However, little was known about their molecular mechanism in pathogenesis of SZ and BD. Here, we performed RNA sequencing on 82 post-mortem brain tissues from three brain regions (orbitofrontal cortex (BA11), anterior cingulate cortex (BA24) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9)) of patients with SZ and BD and control subjects, generating over one billion reads. We characterized lincRNA transcriptome in the three brain regions and identified 20 differentially expressed lincRNAs (DELincRNAs) in BA11 for BD, 34 and 1 in BA24 and BA9 for SZ, respectively. Our results showed that these DELincRNAs exhibited brain region-specific patterns. Applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we revealed that DELincRNAs together with other genes can function as modules to perform different functions in different brain regions, such as immune system development in BA24 and oligodendrocyte differentiation in BA9. Additionally, we found that DNA methylation alteration could partly explain the dysregulation of lincRNAs, some of which could function as enhancers in the pathogenesis of major psychosis. Together, we performed systematical characterization of dysfunctional lincRNAs in multiple brain regions of major psychosis, which provided a valuable resource to understand their roles in SZ and BD pathology and helped to discover novel biomarkers. Overall design: RNA sequencing of 82 brain samples including each of 19 from BA9 and BA24 and 44 from BA11. We performed RNA sequencing on three brain regions namely the BA11 (part of orbitofrontal cortex), BA24 (part of anterior cingulate) and BA9 (part of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) from SZ and BD patients and psychiatrically normal individuals.In summary, there were 44 BA11 samples from 16 SZ, 16 BD and 12 control subjects, and 19 BA24 and 19 BA9 samples from the same subjects including 6 SZ, 7 BD and 6 controls."

RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique to investigate the complexity of gene expression in the human brain. We used RNA-seq to survey the brain transcriptome in high-quality post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 11 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) and from 11 age- and gender-matched controls.  Deep sequencing was performed, with over 350 million reads per specimen. At a false-discovery rate of <5%, we detected 5 differentially-expressed (DE) genes and 12 DE transcripts, most of which have not been previously implicated in BD.  Among these, PROM1/CD133 and ABCG2 play important roles in neuroplasticity. We also show for the first time differential expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in BD.  DE transcripts include those of SRSF5 and RFX4, which along with lncRNAs play a role in mammalian circadian rhythms. The DE genes were significantly enriched for several Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Of these, genes involved with GTPase binding were also enriched for BD-associated SNPs from previous genome-wide association studies, suggesting that differential expression of these genes is not simply a consequence of BD or its treatment.  Many of these findings were replicated by microarray in an independent sample of 60 cases and controls. These results highlight common pathways for inherited and non-inherited influences on disease risk that may constitute good targets for novel therapies. Overall design: Brain transcriptome in bipolar disorder"

Methods: RNA-Seq was performed using strand-specific Ribosomal RNA depletion (RiboZero) library preparation and the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 kit from Illumina. One hundred base pair paired-end sequencing was run on the HiSeq 2000. TopHat (v2.0.4) was used to enforce strand specificity and to align the sequencing reads to known transcripts of the Ensembl Build GRCh37.67. FeatureCounts (v1.4.4) was used to count the total number of reads overlapping each gene using the default settings, with paired-end and reverse-stranded counting specified using the Ensembl Build GRCh37.67 gtf file. These counts were merged from both reads of the paired-end sequencing and normalized by library size and coding gene length to form Reads Per Kilobase of Gene per Million mapped reads (RPKM) values. The influence of diagnosis on expression was analyzed with linear regression transcriptome-wide and further evaluated using a gene set analysis. Results: There was no significant diagnosis effect on any of the individual genes but expression of the gene set of HNMT, HRH1, HRH2, and HRH3 was significantly altered. Conclusions: Our study represents the first specific analysis of the expression of histamine related genes in ASD and suggests that these genes may collectively be dysregulated. Overall design: Comparison of gene expression of 13 ASD cases and 39 matched controls."

Yet, identification of these features might help us to understand both the evolution and nature of the human cognitive traits. Here, we approached this question by analyzing gene expression and H3K27ac chromatin modification data collected in eight brain regions of humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbon and macaques. Integrated analysis of these data revealed existence of 1,851  human-specific transcriptome differences affecting one or multiple brain regions, in contrast to 240 chimpanzee-specific ones. More than a half of these differences represented elevated expression in human hippocampus, while the rest affected microglial functions in neocortex. Analysis of predicted regulatory interactions driving these differences revealed role of transcription factors in species-specific transcriptome changes, while epigenetic modifications were linked to spatial expression differences conserved across species. Overall design: Transcriptome across eight brain regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, premotor cortex, primary visual cortex, striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum) of humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and gibbon were measured using RNA-seq."

"human","data_sources/sra","SRP013825",24,"Transcriptomes of germinal zones of human and mouse fetal neocortex suggest a role of extracellular matrix in progenitor self-renewal.","The expansion of the neocortex during mammalian brain evolution results primarily from an increase in neural progenitor cell divisions in its two principal germinal zones during development, the ventricular zone (VZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ). Using mRNA sequencing, we analyzed the transcriptomes of fetal human and embryonic mouse VZ, SVZ and cortical plate (CP). We describe sets of genes that are up- or down-regulated in each germinal zone. These data suggest that cell adhesion and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions promote the proliferation and self-renewal of neural progenitors in the developing human neocortex. Notably, relevant ECM-associated genes include distinct sets of collagens, laminins, proteoglycans and integrins, along with specific sets of growth factors and morphogens. Our data establish a basis for identifying novel cell-type markers and open up avenues to unravel the molecular basis of neocortex expansion during evolution. Overall design: Total RNA was isolated from the VZ, inner SVZ (ISVZ), outer SVZ (OSVZ) and CP of six 13-16 weeks post-conception (w.p.c.) human fetuses and from the VZ, SVZ and CP of five E14.5 mouse embryos using laser capture microdissection of Nissl-stained cryosections of dorsolateral telencephalon. Poly A+ RNA was used as template for the preparation of cDNA which were then subjected to single-end 76-bp RNA-Seq."
"human","data_sources/sra","SRP101890",20,"Neuronal brain region-specific DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility are associated with neuropsychiatric trait heritability [RNA-Seq]","We analyzed differential methylation (via WGBS) between four distinct human brain regions (NAcc-nucleus accumbens, BA9-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, BA24-anterior cingulate cortex, and HC-hippocampus) in both sorted nuclei and intact tissues. We isolated neuronal and non-neuronal (glial) nuclei from the same six individuals for each tissue via FACS using the neuronal marker, NeuN. Additionally, we performed WGBS from non-sorted tissues from these same brain regions in a total of 12 individuals (BA9 n = 9; BA24 n = 5; HC n = 6; NAcc n = 7). To complement our DNA methylation analyses, we measured gene expression (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) in neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei from the nucleus accumbens and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from six more individuals. We then performed an integrative analysis to understand how the epigenome contributes to brain region-specific function. Overall design: 72 WGBS libraries were sequenced (from intact tissue (27 libraries) and NeuN+ and NeuN- flow sorted nuclei (45 libraries)) from hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex (BA9), and anterior cingulate gyrus (BA24). RNA-seq (20 libraries) and ATAC-seq (23 libraries) data from NeuN+ and NeuN- flow sorted nuclei from the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex (BA9) were also obtained."
"human","data_sources/sra","SRP143388",12,"Loss of the Chr16p11.2 candidate gene QPRT leads to aberrant neuronal differentiation","Background: Altered neuronal development is discussed as underlying pathogenic mechanism of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Copy number variations of 16p11.2 have recurrently been identified in individuals with ASD. Of the 29 genes within this region quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) showed the strongest regulation during in-vitro neuronal differentiation. We hypothesized a causal relation between this tryptophan related enzyme and neuronal differentiation. We thus analyzed the effect of QPRT on differentiation of a neuronal cell line and specifically focused on neuronal morphology, metabolites of the tryptophan pathway and the neurodevelopmental transcriptome. Methods: The gene dosage dependent change of QPRT expression following Chr16p11.2 deletion was investigated in a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) of a deletion carrier and compared to his non-carrier parents. Expression of QPRT was tested for correlation with neuromorphology in SH-SY5Y cells. QPRT function was inhibited in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells using (i) siRNA knockdown (KD), (ii) chemical inhibition, and (iii) complete CRISPR/Cas9 induced knockout (KO). QPRT-KD cells underwent morphological analysis. Chemically inhibited and QPRT-KO cells were characterized using viability assays. Additionally, QPRT-KO cells underwent metabolite and whole transcriptome analyses. Genes differentially expressed upon KO of QPRT were tested for enrichment in biological processes and co-regulated gene-networks of the human brain. Results: QPRT expression was reduced in the LCL of the deletion carrier and significantly correlated with neurite maturation in SH-SY5Y cells. The reduction of QPRT altered neuronal morphology of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Chemical inhibition as well as complete KO of the gene were lethal upon induction of neuronal differentiation, but not proliferation. The QPRT associated tryptophan pathway was not affected by KO. At the transcriptome level neuronal processes like “synapse organization” were affected. Differentially regulated genes were enriched for ASD-candidates and co-regulated gene networks were implicated in the development of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. Conclusions: In this study QPRT was causally related to in vitro neuronal differentiation and affected the regulation of genes and gene-networks that were previously implicated in ASD. Thus, our data suggest that QPRT may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ASD in Chr16p11.2 deletion carriers. Overall design: MACE (massive analysis of cDNA ends) analysis of 12 samples, consisting of 3 replicates each for SH-SY5Y wild type (WT) cells, 2 different CRISPR/Cas9 induced QPRT knockout cell lines (del268T, ins395A) and cells harbouring the empty control vector (eCtrl) after 3 days of BDNF-RA induced neuronal differentiation."

The brain dataset was obtained by sequencing total RNAs extracted from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of five deceased human patients with no apparent pathology, followed by depletion of ribosomal RNA to obtain all non-rRNA coding and non-coding RNAs in the human brain transcriptome. Overall design: Five samples were sequenced, four coming from frozen brain tissue (frontal cortex) of deceased female human patients with no remarkable pathology, and one from a male patient with no remarkable pathology."
